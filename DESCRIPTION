Description: Implements a spatial Bayesian non-parametric factor analysis model 
    with inference in a Bayesian setting using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). 
    Spatial correlation is introduced in the columns of the factor loadings 
    matrix using a Bayesian non-parametric prior, the probit stick-breaking 
    process. Areal spatial data is modeled using a conditional autoregressive 
    (CAR) prior and point-referenced spatial data is treated using a Gaussian 
    process. The response variable can be modeled as Gaussian, probit, Tobit, or
    Binomial (using Polya-Gamma augmentation). Temporal correlation is 
    introduced for the latent factors through a hierarchical structure and can 
    be specified as exponential or first-order autoregressive. Full details of 
    the package can be found in the accompanying vignette. Furthermore, the 
    details of the package can be found in "Bayesian Non-Parametric Factor 
    Analysis for Longitudinal Spatial Surfaces", by Berchuck et al (2019), 
    <doi:10.1214/20-BA1253> in Bayesian Analysis.
