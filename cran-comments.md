## Re-Submission of version 1.0 of spBFA
This is a re-submission of the spBFA R package. The following has been changed:
* For the example in the function "bfa_sp", we changed the tag from \dontrun to \donttest. It is not realistic to get a test of the the function bfa_sp under 5 seconds, so this seems appropriate. Thanks.

## Test environments
* Mac: x86_64-apple-darwin13.4.0 (64-bit), R 3.5.1
* Linux: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit), R 3.4.2
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, or WARNINGs.

There was 1 NOTE:

* New submission

###This NOTE does not impact the build of the package.
