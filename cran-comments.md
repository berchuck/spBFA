## Submission of version 1.0 of spBFA
This package implements a Bayesian non-parametric spatial factor analysis. There is currently no reference for this methodology. There is a paper that is to be submitted to a journal in the next month and then a version of the manuscript will be placed on arXiv.org. I plan on updating the spBFA R package with the arXiv.org reference when it is available (and then the journal reference when it is published).
